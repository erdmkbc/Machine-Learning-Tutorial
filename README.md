# Machine Learning 

## It contains 4 data for now

### Audi data
*The data has audi cars 1997 and 2020 between years some features where feaurues in below and trying to guess price in dependent where feature in below.*

*Using three regression models because 'price' feature is continuous label*

##### Content
* Average price by years
* Transmision type by years
* Fuel types by years
* Model types by years
* Avarage MPG by years
* Avarage Engine Size by years
* General display of numerical features by year
* ML Preprocessing
* Obtain train and test spliting process
* Encoding categorical features for learning processes
* Used to Label encoder.
* Train and test split
* Learning Time !
* Linear Regression
* Decision tree regressor
* Random Forest regressor
* Compare the regressions's r2 score

### Cancer data
*The data, has cancer cells feature where feature in below and trying to diagnose in dependent of feauture.*
*Using Logistic Regression method the method that are basic of artifical neural networks and good performs if data has a binary labels.*

##### Content
* ML preprocessings
* Tryin to understand data
* Encoding labels with LabelEncoder method
* Implement to variables
* Normalization values
* Train and test splitting
* Logistic Regression
  * Implementing initilazing parameters and sigmoid function
  * Implementing forward and backward propagation
  * Implementing and update parameters
  * Implementing prediction
  * Implementing Logistic Regression
* Logistic Regression with sklearn

### Stroke Prediction data 

*The stroke prediction data set trying to guess to stroke status in dependent some features where features below.*

*Using Logistic Regression method the method that are basic of artifical neural networks and good performs if data has a binary labels.*

##### Content
* Imported data
* Load to data
* Tried to understand data
* Control the missing value
* Feature engineering
  * Correlation numerical values
  * Smoking status by gender type and relation with stroke
  * Smoking status by work type relation with stroke
  * Smoking status by age mean relation with stroke
  * Smoking status by avg_glucose_level mean relation with stroke
  * Smoking status by bmi mean relation with stroke
  * Genaral visualization for that we did feature engineering
  * Density map of numerical values(hypertension; age and bmi level relation)
* Examined to median values in numerical values
* Control the outlier values for numerical values
* Filling the missing value
* Obtained training and testing variables for learning proceses
* Encoding catagorical features with label encoder for learning processes
* Learning time!
  * Logistic Regression

# The machine learning algorithms that we used

## Linear Regression
![linear reggreasion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51100947/121821481-01afd180-cca2-11eb-929f-32bf14b587ef.png)

The model usefull for continous labels 

*The goal is try to draw the most optimized line.*
*Tryin to minimize MSE(mean squared eror).*

![polynomial regression](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51100947/121821640-f01af980-cca2-11eb-97cd-3d114ddf41f8.png)
#### *If our data has parabolic density we use polynomial form.*


## Decision Tree

*Algorithm that the best try to splitting the coordinate plane into many parts(terminal leaf we can say) and makes predictions as a result of comparisons.*

## Random forest 


*The algorithm usefull for recommendation algorithms(for example Netflix and YouTube recommendations)*
*Random forest actually, has a lot of decision trees's results that we avarage results.*
